A Highly Efficient Vehicle Taillight Detection Approach Based on Deep Learning

A vision-based hierarchical framework for autonomous front-vehicle taillights detection and signal recognition
HSV = hue saturation value filter, SVM = Support Vector Machine
HSV, HOG, SVM
only day
studied tail light detection and signal recognition including turn signals. Their approach included bounding box extraction, a preprocessing stage in HSV colorspace, and signal classification. Bounding box extraction was based on HOG, a pairing algorithm, as well as a support vector machine. The preprocessing stage included HSV colorspace, clustering, and the orientation and location of taillight pairs inside the bounding box. A dictionary learning algorithm was used for the classification stage. The study primarily focused on closely located vehicles, i.e., 5–40 m.
In machine vision-based vehicle brake light lighting detection research [13], research is being conducted based on the number of red color pixels of vehicle brake lights using RGB color information.

Appearance-based brake-lights recognition using deep learning and vehicle detection
HOG, CNN
Day
have proposed another brake light detection algorithm based on extracting vehicle rears utilizing a HOG detector. They modified the original HOG detector to better suit the purpose of using road- and vehicle-specific information. The brake light status of a vehicle was evaluated using a CNN classifier, which was trained with images of vehicles with brake lights either on or off. Their classifier achieved an average accuracy of 89% with ten-fold cross-validation on their self-gathered non-public data.
a feature was extracted and learned from labeled vehicle regions using a pre-trained AlexNet model to detect vehicles. The vehicle is detected using the trained AlexNet object detector, and the location is determined using the brake lights pattern in the detected vehicle region. In their method, it is necessary to generate brake light patterns in advance from a large database of vehicle rear images. However, there is a problem that the patterns of brake lights differ depending on the size, type, and shape of the vehicle, and the patterns may vary depending on the type of vehicle in the vehicle database built in advance.

Daytime preceding vehicle brake light detection using monocular vision
HOG, LAB
HOG = histogram of oriented gradients, LAB = L*a*b filter
Day
utilized HOG to capture the vehicle bounding boxes. They identified lower two tail light candidate regions from these bounding boxes as radially symmetric areas that were found on a common horizontal plane. In other words, the two brake lights should exist as a pair symmetric with respect to the vehicle center line. These regions were filtered with an L*a*b filter. The brake light status was then detected based on high red chromaticity difference to the tail light region, as the lights only occupy some of the tail light region. Their approach yielded an accuracy of 87.6% on their own non-public dataset.

Vision-based method for forward vehicle brake lights recognition
proposed detecting forward-driving vehicles to prevent vehicle rear collision warnings and detecting whether RGB color information-based vehicle braking was operated. The proposed method uses a Haar-based AdaBoost cascade classifier to detect vehicles. Then, the position of the vehicle brake lights is detected using the color, shape, and structural characteristic information of the detected vehicle between image frames. Moreover, it is detected whether the change of the RGB color value at the vehicle brake lights position is turned on using the threshold method. Their proposal is a method applicable to daytime hours and has limitations in application in places where various lighting and environments change, such as road tunnels.

A Collision Warning Oriented Brake Lights Detection and Classification Algorithm Based on a Mono Camera Sensor
the vehicle is first detected using the YOLO object detector. Moreover, after converting the color space of the detected vehicle region into the L*a*b color space, a method using the support vector machine (SVM) learner was proposed. Their proposed method is a method to detect whether vehicle brake lights are turned on general roads during the daytime, and a detection accuracy of about 96.3% was presented.

used the you only look once version 3 (YOLO v3) vehicle detectors trained on 100,000 COCO datasets to detect vehicles in input images. Then, in order to detect whether the brake lights of the detected vehicle are turned on or not, the RGB color space of the detected vehicle region is converted into a L*a*b color space and then learned using a random forest algorithm. The proposal assumes that there are brake lights at the center of the vehicle and that there are no brake light failures. High-definition input images are required by performing L*a*b color space filtering to perform learning on images that are turned on and off. In addition, when the vehicle taillights are automatically turned on in a low-illuminance environment such as in a road tunnel, there is a problem in that the brake lights may be mis-detected as being turned on. Additionally, the random forest algorithm has a disadvantage in that it consumes a lot of memory during training.
